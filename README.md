Scheme interpreter collection.

## A way to learn new language
I think writing a Scheme interpreter is a good practice for learning a new language because it is a challenging but rewarding task.
It also sets a benchmark for programming language proficiency: I only claim I am familiar with language X if I can write a scheme interpreter in it. 


Inspired by [JScheme](http://norvig.com/jscheme.html).
