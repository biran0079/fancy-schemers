Scheme interpreter collection.

## A way to learn new language
I think writing a Scheme interpreter is a good practice for learning a new language because it is a challenging but rewarding task.
It also sets a benchmark for programming language proficiency: I only claim I am familiar with language X if I can write a scheme interpreter in it. 

## Test
I stole [r4rstest.scm](http://norvig.com/jscheme/r4rstest.scm) from [JScheme](http://norvig.com/jscheme.html) website with delay/force test commented out.

## Implementations

Language | Status
---------|---------
Scheme   | Passed
Cpp      | Failed
